# DevOps Playground

Welcome to my hands-on laboratory for DevOps and Cloud Engineering. This repository contains a collection of projects focused on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **Container Orchestration**, **CI/CD automation**, and **Cloud-Native architectures**.

Each project represents a real-world scenario designed to improve deployment speed, system reliability, and operational excellence.
